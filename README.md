# KRYPT - BLOCKCHAIN SMART CONTRACT

This project demonstrates a basic blockchain use case built with solidity. It comes with a Transactions contract, a test for that contract (in-progress), and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
